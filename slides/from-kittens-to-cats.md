# Math review

## Natural numbers
# `1 + 2 = 3`

----

## Natural numbers
- Given a `natural number`
- And given another `natural number`
- And the `addition` operation
- We can get another `natural number`

----

## Rational numbers
## `1.2 + 8.3 = 9.5`

----

## Rational numbers
- Given a `rational number`
- And given another `rational number`
- And the `addition` operation
- We can get another `rational number`

----

## Strings

```
"foo" + "bar" == "foobar"
```

----

## Strings
- Given a `String`
- And given another `String`
- And the `concatenate` operation
- We can get another `String`

----

### Natural numbers, rational numbers, and `String`s are **structured similarly**.

----

### ðŸ¤” Can the **common structure** be factored out?

----

### **Category theory** is the study of similarly structured things.

Where things include numbers.

----

### `cats` is the application of **cat**egory theory to types in Scala

----

### `cats` provides a **consistent interface** to different types in Scala **if** they are structured similarly

Interface as in "coding experience", not literally a Java `interface`

---

## The structure

----

### Built-in types

```scala
// Int
1 + 2 == 3

// String
"foo" + "bar" == "foobar"
```

----

### ðŸ¤” What about a new type?

```scala
case class Frac(numerator: Int, denominator: Int)

// built-in + not defined for Frac
Frac(1, 2) + Frac(3, 4) == Frac(7, 8)
```

## ðŸ’¥

----

### `+` could be a normal method off of `Frac`...

```scala
case class Frac(numerator: Int, denominator: Int) {
  def `+`(that: Frac): Frac =
    ???
}
```

----

### But what about structural sharing with `Int` and `String`?

![](diagrams/100-no-common-parent.png)

----

![](diagrams/110-can-plus.png)

We introduce a **new abstraction** that describes the structure of the original types.

----

```scala
1 |+| 2 == 3

"foo" |+| "bar" == "foobar"

Frac(1, 2) |+| Frac(3, 4) == Frac(7, 8)
```

`CanPlus[_]` also provides a `|+|` operator to all types that support this structure...

...regardless of the type's owner.

----

### `CanPlus[_]` is an example of a **type class**

a mechanism in Scala/Haskell used to describe the structure of other types


----

## Instances

- `CanPlus[Int]` describes that `Int` can plus...
- `CanPlus[String]` describes that `String` can plus...
- `CanPlus[Frac]` describes that `Frac` can plus...
- Also called providing "proof" or "evidence" with a **type class instance**

----

## `cats` provides...

- Common **type classes**
- Evidence for those type classes for built-in Scala types
- The opportunity for first or third-party types to provide evidence

----

## ðŸ“š Not covered

- `cats` syntax
- `implicit` injection

# The structure

# Recap

----

`cats` is a Scala library that enhances the **functional programming** experience by providing **consistent interfaces** to types that share similar properties by using **type classes** and **evidence**.
