## Natural numbers
# `1 + 2 = 3`

----

## Natural numbers
- Given a `natural number`
- And given another `natural number`
- And the `addition` operation
- We can get another `natural number`

----

## Rational numbers
## `1.2 + 8.3 = 9.5`

----

## Rational numbers
- Given a `rational number`
- And given another `rational number`
- And the `addition` operation
- We can get another `rational number`

----

## Strings

```
"foo" + "bar" == "foobar"
```

----

## Strings
- Given a `String`
- And given another `String`
- And the `concatenate` operation
- We can get another `String`

### Natural numbers, rational numbers, and `String`s are **structured similarly**.

----

### ðŸ¤” Can the **common structure** be factored out?

----

### **Category theory** is the study of similarly structured things.

Where things include numbers.

----

### `cats` is the application of **cat**egory theory to types in Scala

----

### `cats` provides a **consistent interface** to different types in Scala **if** they are structured similarly

Interface as in "coding experience", not literally a Java `interface`

---

## The structure

----

### Built-in types

```scala
1 + 2 == 3
"foo" + "bar" == "foobar"
```

----

### ðŸ¤” What about a new type?

```scala
case class Frac(numerator: Int, denominator: Int)

// built-in + not defined for Frac
Frac(1, 2) + Frac(3, 4) == Frac(7, 8)
```

----

### `+` could be a normal method off of `Frac`...

```scala
case class Frac(numerator: Int, denominator: Int) {
  def `+`: Frac =
    ???
}
```

----

### But what about structural sharing with `Int` and `String`?

# Recap

----

`cats` is a Scala library that enhances the **functional programming** experience by providing **consistent interfaces** to types that share similar properties by using **type classes** and **evidence**.
